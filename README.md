# HardwareAudioMixer
## What is this?

HardwareAudioMixer is a repo containing code necessary to create a dedicated Windows audio mixer hardware controller, by using an arduino (nano), a rotary encoder, a i2c display and 3 mechanical buttons.
Pics/demos to come soon.
Schematics for the hardware will eventually be created, along with .cad files for an enclosure, if made.

## Instructions

S00n (tm)
If you wanna try it in its rough state, look at the .ino file and figure out the pins I'm using, it should be quite easy.

## TO-DO

Scroll text that is too long
Show app name underneath app title if different
Figure out how to get app icons flawlessly (Chrome not working p.e.)
Fix edgeDetector to suit my needs
