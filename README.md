# HardwareAudioMixer
HardwareAudioMixer is a repo containing code necessary to create a dedicated Windows audio mixer controller hardware, by using an arduino (nano), a rotary encoder, a i2c display and 3 mechanical buttons.
Pics/demos to come soon.
Schematics for the hardware will eventually be created, along with .cad files for an enclosure, if made.
